## About Me

Welcome to my personal space on the web! I'm a mechanical engineer turned software developer with a deep passion for programming and technology.

## My Journey

My career started in mechanical engineering, but I quickly realized that software programming was my true passion. Captivated by its limitless potential, I immersed myself in the coding world.

I started off with C++, developing plugins for CAD software used in the mold and plastic industry as well as the shoe industry. This experience allowed me to merge my engineering background with my newfound love for coding, creating tools that enhanced the design and manufacturing processes.

As my interests evolved, I found myself drawn to the backend side of software development. I'm currently working as a Golang backend developer at [xgeeks](https://xgeeks.com), building robust backend services that power complex applications. The simplicity and efficiency of Go have made it an ideal choice for my work, enabling me to develop scalable and maintainable systems.

### Current Project

For almost three years now, I have been working on an exciting project for Mercedes-Benz. The project involves implementing a Namespace as a Service on top of Kubernetes. This initiative aims to streamline and automate the management of namespaces, providing a more efficient and scalable solution for the company's infrastructure needs. My role in this project has allowed me to leverage my expertise in Kubernetes and backend development.

The technology stack used in this project includes Golang, Java, Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, GitHub, GitHub Actions, Postgres, SonarQube, GlitchTip, Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenSearch.

## Certifications

To enhance my expertise, I obtained certifications in Kubernetes (CKAD), GitHub Actions, and SAFe. These credentials demonstrate my dedication to continuous learning and my ambition to stay current with the latest advancements in the field.
